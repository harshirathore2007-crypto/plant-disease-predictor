# 🌿 Simple Plant Disease Predictor

## 📖 Overview of the Project

This is a **minimalist, keyword-based plant disease predictor** implemented in Python. It's designed to help gardeners and plant enthusiasts quickly identify potential common plant diseases or nutrient deficiencies based on a textual description of the symptoms.

The program analyzes user-inputted symptoms (like "white powder on leaves" or "yellow and weak plant") and matches keywords against a predefined dictionary of diseases. It then outputs the most likely disease, its cause, and suggested treatments.
